#Majority Element



The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
explanation: 
    in this array n=3, ⌊n / 2⌋=  floor(3/2) =1
    that means there must have element appears more tha 1 time.
    here 3 appears 2 times in this array

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
explanation: 
    in this array n=7, ⌊n / 2⌋=  floor(7/2) =3
    that means there must have element appears more tha 3 time.
    here 32 appears 4 times in this array
